			<h3>Prospective Undergraduate Research Assistants</h3>
			<p> 
      </p>
      
      <h2>Letter to Undergraduate Applicants</h2>

		<p>Dear Potential Undergraduate Researcher,</p>
 
		<p>Thank you for your interest in becoming involved in the research in the Spokony Lab in the Natural Sciences Department at Baruch College. I believe strongly that experience doing research is a critical component of young scientist’s development. As undergraduate students work in my lab, they are expected to contribute significantly to the intellectual content of their research projects and to ultimately earn authorship on peer-reviewed publications. This requires a significant commitment of time and enthusiasm to the lab group, the research, and to one’s own intellectual development. I am looking for intellectual enthusiasm and the potential to learn quickly rather than a specific skill set or knowledge base. Preference will be given to students early in their college careers.

In each application round (see dates below), I will interview some applicants and then select a small number to join my lab group. I will conduct a similar application and interview process each semester for students starting in the lab the following semester, so students should wait to apply until they are ready to make the commitments listed below and can reapply in subsequent semesters if not selected in the first round. 

Thank you again for your interest and feel free to contact me with any questions. </p>

		<p>Sincerely,</p>
		<p>Rebecca Spokony</p>

			<p>

</p>
</p>


      <h2>Laboratory Expectations</h2>

	<p>The expectations for students joining my lab group are:</p>
		<p>1. Regular attendance and participation</p>
		<p>2. A minimum 2-year commitment to the lab</p>
		<p>3. A average minimum of 3 hours per week of research during the academic year</p>
		<p>4. Yearly presentations of work at research symposia or scientific meetings</p>
		<p>5. Final written reports on all research findings including complete lab notebooks, data files, and analyses</p>
		<p>6. Contribute equally to shared laboratory chores and responsibilities</p>
		<p>7. Registration in 1 hour of research credit per semester when possible</p>
		<p>8. Being willing to apply to apply for external funding resources when recommended</p>
		<p>9. Absolute scientific integrity</p>

	<h2>Application Requirements</h2>

	<p>Research is not easy. It can be tedious and frustrating, but also extremely rewarding. If you feel you are prepared to make the commitments outlined above, 
	please email Dr. Spokony a two page letter/essay on why you want to be involved in teh research, and in my lab group specifically, and your career goals</p>

	<h2>Application Deadlines</h2>

	<p>October 31st by 5 pm for consideration for beginning in the Spring</p>
	<p>March 31st by 5 pm for consideration for beginning in the Summer or Fall</p>
