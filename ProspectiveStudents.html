			<h3>Prospective Undergraduate Research Assistants</h3>
			<p> 
      </p>
      
      <h2>Letter to Undergraduate Applicants</h2>

		<p>Dear Potential Undergraduate Researcher,</p>
 
		<p>Thank you for your interest in becoming involved in the research in the Spokony Lab in the Natural Sciences Department at Baruch College. Participating in research has been shown to greatly 
enhance an undergraduate STEM education. Undergraduate students who work in my lab are expected to contribute significantly to the intellectual content of their research projects and to ultimately earn authorship 
on peer-reviewed publications. This requires a significant commitment of time and enthusiasm to the lab group, the research, and to oneâ€™s own intellectual development. I am looking for intellectual enthusiasm and 
the potential to learn quickly rather than a specific skill set or knowledge base. Preference will be given to students early in their college careers, with interest in participating in research for a minimum of
2 semesters or a semester and a summer. </p>

<p>Independent Study:</p>
<p>Independent Study Applications must be started a minimum of two weeks before they are due (August 1 for fall, December 1 for winter and January 1 for spring). Draft applications must be turned in for comment 
a minimum of one week before the deadline.</p>
		
<p>Thank you again for your interest and feel free to contact me with any questions. </p>

		<p>Sincerely,</p>
		<p>Rebecca Spokony</p>

			<p>

</p>
</p>


      <h2>Laboratory Expectations</h2>

	<p>The expectations for students joining my lab group are:</p>
		<p>1. Regular attendance and participation</p>
		<p>2. A minimum 2-year commitment to the lab</p>
		<p>3. A average minimum of 3 hours per week of research during the academic year</p>
		<p>4. Yearly presentations of work at research symposia or scientific meetings</p>
		<p>5. Final written reports on all research findings including complete lab notebooks, data files, and analyses</p>
		<p>6. Contribute equally to shared laboratory chores and responsibilities</p>
		<p>7. Registration in 1 hour of research credit per semester when possible</p>
		<p>8. Being willing to apply to apply for external funding resources when recommended</p>
		<p>9. Absolute scientific integrity</p>

	<h2>Application Requirements</h2>

	<p>Research is not easy. It can be tedious and frustrating, but also extremely rewarding. If you feel you are prepared to make the commitments outlined above, 
	please email Dr. Spokony a two page letter/essay on why you want to be involved in teh research, and in my lab group specifically, and your career goals</p>

	<h2>Application Deadlines</h2>

	<p>October 31st by 5 pm for consideration for beginning in the Spring</p>
	<p>March 31st by 5 pm for consideration for beginning in the Summer or Fall</p>
